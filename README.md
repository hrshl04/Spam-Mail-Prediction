# Spam-Mail-Prediction
A Python project on Spam mail prediction involves building a machine learning model that can classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or ham.

The project typically involves the following steps:

Data collection: Gathering a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham.
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning model training.
Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the emails that can be used for training the machine learning model.
Model training: Using a machine learning algorithm such as Naive Bayes or Random Forest to train the model on the labeled dataset
